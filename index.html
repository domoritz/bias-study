                <h2>Purpose of the Study</h2>
                <p>
                    Systems for visualizing "big data" often present imprecise visualizations based on sampling, later updating them once all data has been analyzed. We are studying how people interpret precise visualizations after seeing early approximate visualizations.
                </p>
                <h2>Study Procedures</h2>
                <p>
                    We are conducting a study of interpreting visualizations. We expect this survey to take no more than 10 minutes to complete. You are not required to respond to any question that makes you feel uncomfortable, and may end your participation at any point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may refuse to participate and you are free to withdraw from this study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will compensate $2.00 for completing this study.
                </p>
                <h2>Risks</h2>
                <p>
                    You may experience some negative feelings if you are unable to interpret the visualizations. You may skip any question or end your participation at any time. We do not anticipate any physical risks to participants.
                </p>
                <h2>Benefits of the Study</h2>
                <p>
                    You will not directly benefit from taking part in this study, beyond the compensation. However, this research will help inform the design of visualization tools in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>Confidentality of Research Information</h2>
                <p>
                    Taking part in this study is voluntary, and you can stop at any time. The data collected in this study will be held confidential.
