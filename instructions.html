                In this study, you will look at visualizations from a large dataset about recent flights across the United States. The dataset is quite large, and takes a while for a computer to analyze. You will first view sets of visualizations which will be <i>approximately</i> the overall results. Later in the study, once the computation is complete, these visualizations will then be corrected to show the <i>precise</i> results. You will answer some questions at each stage.

                The study consists of three major parts:
                <ol>
                    <li>Viewing 3 approximate visualizations from the flights dataset and answering a few questions about them.</li>
                    <li>Viewing 3 updated, precise visualizations from the flights dataset.</li>
                    <li>Answer a few questions about the dataset.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon answering the questions about the dataset, we will provide you with a code to enter into Amazon Mechanical Turk to denote that you have successfully completed the study.

                We expect the study to take 10 minutes to complete, and will compensate $2.00 for completing it.
