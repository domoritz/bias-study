<p>
    In this study, you will look at visualizations from a large dataset about recent flights across the United States. The dataset is quite large, and takes a while for a computer to analyze. You will first view sets of visualizations which will <i class="blue">approximate</i> the overall results. Later in the study, once the computation is complete, these visualizations will then be corrected to show the <i class="orange">precise</i> results. You will answer some questions at each stage.
</p>

<p>
    The study consists of three major parts:
    <ol>
        <li>Viewing 2 <i class="blue">approximate</i> visualizations and answering a few questions about them.</li>
        <li>Viewing 2 updated, <i class="orange">precise</i> visualizations.</li>
        <li>Answer a few questions about the dataset.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p class="lead">
    When completing this task, please imagine that you are an analyst interested in flights on <strong class="airline"></strong> and flights originating out of <strong class="state"></strong>.
</p>

<p>
    The questions in the study relate to the data associated with <strong class="airline"></strong> and <strong class="state"></strong>, and how it compares to other airlines and states in the dataset.
</p>

<p>
    Upon answering the questions about the dataset, we will provide you with a code to enter into Amazon Mechanical Turk to denote that you have successfully completed the study.
</p>

<p>
    Please don't take notes on the data. We want your answers to reflect what you noticed in the visualizations, not what you wrote down.
